# RIMS-seq
Set of programs to analyze data derived from (Rapid Identification of Methylase Specificity) to simultaneously sequence bacterial genomes and determine m5C methylase specificities. RIMS-seq uses a simple experimental protocol that closely resembles the DNA-seq protocol for Illumina. For more details on RIMS-seq, please read our preprint (link)
